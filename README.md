### Fun Mini Project While Bored

This is a simple project which deals with grouping files contained in a directory to seperate directory within the parent directory according to the file extensions. Suggestions to improve this are welcomed.

Done as one of my workouts for learning [golang](www.golang.org).

> Usage
> `group -dir [path to dir]`
